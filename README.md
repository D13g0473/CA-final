# Cross-Fading Image Processing - Parallel Computing Project

This project implements cross-fading between a color image and its grayscale version using sequential, MPI (distributed memory), and OpenMP (shared memory) approaches.

## Project Structure

- `sequential.cpp` - Sequential implementation
- `mpi_parallel.cpp` - MPI parallel implementation for distributed memory
- `openmp_parallel.cpp` - OpenMP parallel implementation for shared memory
- `benchmark.sh` - Script to run performance benchmarks
- `analyze_results.py` - Python script to analyze results and generate reports
- `create_video.sh` - Script to create videos from generated frames

## Requirements

- C++ compiler with C++11 support
- OpenCV 4.x
- MPI library (e.g., OpenMPI)
- OpenMP support
- Python 3 with pandas, matplotlib, numpy
- ImageMagick (for creating test images)
- FFmpeg (for video creation)

## Compilation

```bash
# Sequential version
g++ -std=c++11 sequential.cpp -o sequential `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`

# MPI version
mpic++ -std=c++11 mpi_parallel.cpp -o mpi_parallel `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`

# OpenMP version
g++ -std=c++11 -fopenmp openmp_parallel.cpp -o openmp_parallel `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
```

## Usage

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
chmod +x benchmark.sh
./benchmark.sh
```

This will:
1. Create test images of sizes 800x800, 2000x2000, and 5000x5000
2. Compile all programs
3. Run benchmarks for each implementation and configuration
4. Generate results.csv with timing data

### Analyzing Results

```bash
python3 analyze_results.py
```

This will generate:
- `results_with_metrics.csv` - Results with speedup and efficiency
- `performance_analysis.png` - Performance plots
- `speedup_efficiency_analysis.png` - Speedup and efficiency plots
- `performance_report.md` - Detailed analysis report

### Creating Videos

```bash
chmod +x create_video.sh
./create_video.sh
```

## Problem Description

The program generates a 4-second video (96 frames at 24 fps) showing the cross-fading transition from a color image to its grayscale version. The cross-fading formula used is:

```
result[x][y].r = color[x][y].r * P + gray[x][y].r * (1-P)
result[x][y].g = color[x][y].g * P + gray[x][y].g * (1-P)
result[x][y].b = color[x][y].b * P + gray[x][y].b * (1-P)
```

Where P varies from 1.0 to 0.0 over the 96 frames.

## Parallel Implementations

### MPI (Distributed Memory)
- Uses message passing for communication between processes
- Distributes image rows among processes for parallel processing
- Suitable for clusters and multi-node systems

### OpenMP (Shared Memory)
- Uses threads for parallel processing within a single node
- Parallelizes loops using `#pragma omp parallel for`
- Suitable for multi-core systems

## Performance Metrics

- **Speedup**: Sequential time / Parallel time
- **Efficiency**: Speedup / Number of processes/threads

## Results

The analysis compares performance across different image sizes (800x800, 2000x2000, 5000x5000) and parallel configurations (2, 4, 8 processes/threads).

## Video Creation

Generated frames can be combined into videos using FFmpeg. The resulting videos demonstrate the smooth cross-fading effect between color and grayscale versions of the input image.

## Academic Context

This project fulfills the requirements of the "Computaci√≥n Avanzada" course final practical assignment, demonstrating understanding of parallel programming concepts, performance analysis, and comparative implementation of sequential vs. parallel algorithms.# CA-final
